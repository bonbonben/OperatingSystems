Goal:
1. Write a Linux kernel module + a user program
2. The kernel module will generate a /proc file when it is installed
3. When the user program reads the file generated by the kernel module, the kernel module will return the ID(s) of all the executed process(es)
4. The kernel module outputs "goodbye" when it is removed, and removes the file generated by the kernel module

Step 1: Use Makefile
Step 2: Enter "sudo insmod proc.ko" to install
Step 3: Enter "cat /proc/proc" to see pid
Step 4: Enter "sudo rmmod proc.ko" to remove
Step 5: Enter "dmesg | tail -1" to see if there is "goodbye" message
